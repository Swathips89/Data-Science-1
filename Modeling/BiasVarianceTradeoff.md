### Bias-Variance
* Bias is how far model's predictions are from correctness
* Variance is the degree to which these predictions vary between model iterations.

### Low Bias & Low Variance are desired
![](https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/bias-variance-total-error.jpg)
* Model is complex = Bias is low and Variance is high
* Model is simple = Bias is high and Variance is low
* High Bias = Both Training and Test error are high
* High Variance = Training error is low but Test error is high

### Model Performance
* High Variance or Overfitting: Train set error = 1%, Validation Set error = 11%
* High Bias or Underfitting: Trainset error = 15%, Validation Set error = 16%
