* Bias is how far model's predictions are from correctness
* Variance is the degree to which these predictions vary between model iterations.

* Model is complex = Bias is low and Variance is high
* Model is simple = Bias is high and Variance is low
* High Bias = Both Training and Test error are high
* High Variance = Training error is low but Test error is high
