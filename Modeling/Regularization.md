Complex models are bad. One of the ways to keep our model simple is by applying regularization and adjust the rate until we achieve an acceptable performance. 

### Ways
* Early stopping
* Parameter Norm Penalities
  * L1 regularization
  * L2 regularization
  * Max-norm regularization
* Dataset Augmentation
* Noise robustness
* Sparse representations
