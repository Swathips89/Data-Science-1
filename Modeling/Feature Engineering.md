### Numeric
* Values as it is
* Unique Counts/Freq
* Binning
* Binarize based on a cut-off
* Rounding off - High precision may not be required
* Interaction between variables
* Binning

* Bearing Between the two Lat/Lons

* Distances (great circle distance and road distance calculated by the routing graph)
* Number of turns with the ratio of left to right turns, number of traffic lights, junctions, and bridges 
* Complexity of the road - graph-calculated distance divided by the GCD
* 
* Proximity of a point to the subway
* Number of stories in the building
* Distance to the nearest store
* Number of ATMs around, etc. 
* Height above sea level, etc.
