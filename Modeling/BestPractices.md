* In Healthcare - built models for data at differnt points - Reason is that a patient have acquired infection earlier and starts showing syptoms much before the actual test indicators
  * At onset
  * 6 hrs before onset
  * 12 hrs before onset
  
* Can we use Stacking algorithm - 1 model for different subset of variables and combine all the diff models
  * 1 model for time related vars
  * 1 model for demographics related vars
  * 1 model for rate variables - that change with time etc

* Reusuable Holdouts to prevent Over-fitting
