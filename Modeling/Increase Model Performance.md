### Ways to increase model performance
* Get more data
* Collect more diverse training data
* Different algo parameters
* Add regularization
* Try bigger Neural network
* Chnage NN architecture
* Choose dev and test sets to reflect data you expect to get in the future
and want to do well on. Test set should not simply be 30% of the available data, try creating data that approximates what you expect to get in the future
* Choose development/Validation and Test sets that are drawn from the same distribution. They shouldn't be entirely different 
*
