### Techniques
* Do Nothing
* Sampling
  * Oversample the minority class.
  * Undersample the majority class.
  * Synthesize new minority classes.
* Anomaly Detection
* Adjust the decision threshold.
* Adjust the class weight (misclassification costs).
* Modify an existing algorithm to be more sensitive to rare classes.

### Evaluation Metrics
* Always test(Test set) on original distribution 
* ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, Lift or Gain curves
* Decision threshold on predict_proba
*
