### Model Interpretation
* Model performance is not the run-time or execution performance, but how accurate the model can be in making decisions.
* What drives model predictions? Which features are imp in decision-making policies of the model - ensures fairness of the model
* Why did the model take a certain decision? Validate and justify why certain key features were responsible in driving certain decisions taken by a model during predictions - ensures accountability and reliability of the model.
