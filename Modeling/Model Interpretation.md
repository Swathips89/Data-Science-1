### Model Interpretation
When comparing models, besides model performance, a model is said to have a better interpretability than another model if its decisions are easier to understand by a human than the decisions from the other model.
* Model performance is not the run-time or execution performance, but how accurate the model can be in making decisions.
* What drives model predictions? Which features are imp in decision-making policies of the model - ensures fairness of the model.
* Why did the model take a certain decision? Validate and justify why certain key features were responsible in driving certain decisions taken by a model during predictions - ensures accountability and reliability of the model.
* How can we trust model predictions? We should be able to evaluate and validate any data point and how a model takes decisions on it - ensures transparency of the model.
