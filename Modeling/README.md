### Problem Statement
* Scope of the model - Model predicts 6hrs before onset of a disease, Before making the decision of discharge at a hospital
* What is time period that is looked at while creating observations for Target & Non-Target population

### Data Cleaning
* Cohort of interest
* Identify & resolves Discrepancies in data

### Data-preprocessing
* Univariate analysis - Data cleaning
* Outlier treatment
* Missing value treatment
* Data Transformation - Right skewed/Left skewed
* Feature engineering - Numeric/Categorical/DateTime Vars - Transactional data/Temporal data
* Feature selection
* Split data into - Train, Validation & Test

### Model Building
* Overfitting - Cross Validation, Regularization

### Evaluation & Comparision
* Precision-Recall Curves, AUC Curves - To determine the cut-off for an effective model
