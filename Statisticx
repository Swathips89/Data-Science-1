# Difference between parametric and non-parametric methods:
The field of statistics exists because it is usually impossible to collect data from all individuals of interest (population). 
Our only solution is to collect data from a subset (sample) of the individuals of interest, but our real desire is to know the “truth” 
about the population. Quantities such as means, standard deviations and proportions are allimportant values and are called “parameters” 
when we are talking about a population. Since we usually cannot get data from the whole population, we cannot know the values 
of the parameters for that population. We can, however, calculate estimates of these quantities for our sample. When they are calculated 
from sample data, these quantities are called “statistics.” 

Parametric statistical procedures rely on the shape of distribution of the underlying population
Non-parametric procedure doesn't rely on those assumptions.
