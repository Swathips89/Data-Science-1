Algorithms used in Recommender Systems - Bayesian,Decision Tree,Matrix factorization-based,Neighbor-based ,Neural Network, Rule Learning,Ensemble ,Gradient descent-based,Kernel methods,Clustering ,Associative classification,Bandit, Lazy learning,Regularization methods,Topic Independent Scoring Algorithm <br/>

Collaborative filtering: The process of filtering used by most of the recommender systems to find patterns or information by collaborating viewpoints, various data sources and multiple agents. <br/>

A Recommendation system is a sub-class of information filtering that seeks to predict the rating or preference a user would give to an item
Eg: Amazon-Next to buy, Travel websites-Next Destination, Netflix-Movies, News
* What is recommended
* How it is recommended
* When it is recommended
* Where it is recommended

Matrix foundation 
* AB Test: Consider analysing other factors/confounding vars that might impact the results </br>
How do you measure the outcome - wch outcome is imp? 
  * Customer spensing more time on netflix?
  * Public joy?
  * Long-term rewards
  * Production bias, recommendation bias
  
* Personalization: 
  * Maximize member's enjoyment of the selected show
  * Minimize the time it takes to find them
  * Ordering the titles in each row (Diff categories/genres) is personalized
  * Selection and placement of each row types is personalized
  * Personalized images on same movie
  * Model using
    * User's taste
    * Context: Time, Device, country, Language
    * Difference in local tastes: Not available!= Not popular 

* Latent Models for recommendation:
  * Shallow
    * Latent factor models -- Matrix Factorization
    * Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
  * Deep
    * Variational Autoencoder
    * Feedforward Neural Networks
    * Sequential Neural Networks (RNN)
    * Convolutional Neural Networks
