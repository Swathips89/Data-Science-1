Algorithms used in Recommender Systems - Bayesian,Decision Tree,Matrix factorization-based,Neighbor-based ,Neural Network, Rule Learning,Ensemble ,Gradient descent-based,Kernel methods,Clustering ,Associative classification,Bandit, Lazy learning,Regularization methods,Topic Independent Scoring Algorithm <br/>

Collaborative filtering: The process of filtering used by most of the recommender systems to find patterns or information by collaborating viewpoints, various data sources and multiple agents. <br/>

A Recommendation system is a sub-class of information filtering that seeks to predict the rating or preference a user would give to an item
Eg: Amazon-Next to buy, Travel websites-Next Destination, Netflix-Movies, News

Matrix foundation 
* AB Test: Consider analysing other factors/confounding vars that might impact the results </br>
How do you measure the outcome - wch outcome is imp? 
  * Customer spensing more time on netflix?
  * Public joy?
  * Long-term rewards
  * Production bias, recommendation bias
