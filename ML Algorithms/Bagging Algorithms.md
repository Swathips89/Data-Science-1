### Random Forest
* Bootstrap sampling - sampling of the input data with replacement. One-third of data is not used for training and set aside called out of bag samples.
* Random Forest is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks but it does not give precise continuous nature predictions. In case of regression, it doesnâ€™t predict beyond the range in the training data, and that they may over-fit data sets that are particularly noisy.
* It also performs dimensional reduction methods, treats missing values, outlier values. 
* It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.
* It has methods for balancing errors in data sets where classes are imbalanced.
* A group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.
* Handles large data set with higher dimensionality.
* It usually has high accuracy on the training population and hence might over fit the model on the data.
