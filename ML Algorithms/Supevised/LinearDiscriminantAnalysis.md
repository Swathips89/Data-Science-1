### Overview
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm traditionally limited to only two-class classification problems. If you have more than two classes then the Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm is the preferred linear classification technique.

* LDA is similar to PCA, but creates variables such that the target classes are separated

### Assumptions
* Data has Gaussian distribution
