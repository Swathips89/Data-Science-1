### Overview
* “Support Vector Machine” (SVM) can be used for both classification or regression challenges. 
* It is widely used in Binary classification problems. 
* Classification is performed by choosing a hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well 
* Support Vectors are simply the co-ordinates of individual observation. Support Vector Machine is a frontier which best segregates the two classes (hyper-plane/ line). Selecting hyper-plane:
  * Select the hyper-plane which segregates the two classes better
  * After selecting the hyper-plane that segregates 2 class well then choose hyper-plane with higher margin (Margin is distance between nearest data point (either class) and hyper-plane)
* Kernel trick is where low dimensional input space is transformed into a higher dimensional space i.e. it converts not separable problem to separable problem, these functions are called kernels.
