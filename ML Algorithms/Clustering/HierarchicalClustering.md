### Overview
Builds hierarchy of clusters. This algorithm starts with all the data points assigned to a cluster of their own. Then two nearest clusters 
are merged into the same cluster. In the end, this algorithm terminates when there is only a single cluster left.
The results of hierarchical clustering can be shown using dendrogram.
