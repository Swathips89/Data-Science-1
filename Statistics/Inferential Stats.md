##### Normal Distributions
Z-Score = (x-µ)/σ

##### Binomial Distribution
Discrete distribution is a distribution for a variable for which only certain values are possible. Eg- whole numbers <br/>
Is an example of discrete distribution where number of outcomes is 2. It describes the number  <br/>
Data represented by the binomial distribution must meet four requirements: <br/>
• The outcome of each trial is one of two mutually exclusive outcomes. <br/>
• Each trial is independent, so the result of one trial has no influence on the result of any other trial. <br/>
• The probability of success, denoted as p, is constant for every trial. <br/>
• There is a fixed number of trials, denoted as n. <br/>
