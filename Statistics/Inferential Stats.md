##### Normal Distributions
Z-Score = (x-µ)/σ

##### Central Limit Theorem
The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean (Sample size of 30 or more) approximates the normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the population from which the samples are drawn if the sample size is sufficiently large. This fact enables us to make statistical inferences based on the properties of the normal distribution, even if the sample is drawn from a population that is not normally distributed.

##### Binomial Distribution
Discrete distribution is a distribution for a variable for which only certain values are possible. Eg- whole numbers <br/>
Is an example of discrete distribution where number of outcomes is 2. It describes the number  <br/>
Data represented by the binomial distribution must meet four requirements: <br/>
• The outcome of each trial is one of two mutually exclusive outcomes. <br/>
• Each trial is independent, so the result of one trial has no influence on the result of any other trial. <br/>
• The probability of success, denoted as p, is constant for every trial. <br/>
• There is a fixed number of trials, denoted as n. <br/>

##### Confidence Intervals
Confidence interval, which is the interval between two values that represent the upper and lower confidence limits or confidence bounds for a statistic. <br/>
Confidence intervals are based on the idea that if a study were repeated an infinite number of times, each time drawing a different sample of the same size from the same population, and a confidence interval based on each sample were constructed, x% of the time the confidence interval would contain the true parameter value that the study seeks to estimate, where x is the size of the confidence interval. For instance, if our test statistic is the mean and we are using a 95% confidence interval, over an infinite number of repetitions of drawing a sample and computing its mean, 95% of the time the confidence interval thus constructed would contain the true mean of the population. <br/>

##### p-value
It is the probability of the observed or the more xtreme value given the null hypothesis is true

##### Data Transformations
* Right skewed data can be made Normal by application of the square-root or log transformations.
