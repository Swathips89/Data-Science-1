### Graphical Representations

##### 2 Quantitative Variables
* Scatter plot - Correlation

Covariance - Variance between 2 variables. Indicates the extent to which two random variables change in tandem. Lies between -∞ and +∞.
Cov(X,Y) = Σ(Xi-Xavg)(Yi-Yavg) / (n-1)

Correlation - Correlation refers to the scaled/Normalized form of covariance. Measure used to represent how strongly two random variables are related. Lies between -1 and +1. Not influenced by change of scale and dimensionless
Corr(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y)/XstdDev.YstdDev

##### 2 Categorical Variables
* Cross Table - Freq or %
* Stacked bar plot - Freq or %

##### Quantitative & Categorical Variables
* Box plot comparision between the groups of Categorical variables
