* 95% Confidence interval means that when we take repeated samples from a population, mean of '95% of the repeated samples' is within the range produced b 95% CI  
* Even when mean of 2 samples is same, CI varies based on the size of the samples. CI is broader for the sample with less samples size and narrow for the sample with more samples size. For sample mean of 100 samples is 0.8, CI is [0.72,0.88], where as sample mean of 500 samples is 0.8 but CI is [0.76,0.84]. More the sample size, greater chance of its mean closer to the population sample.
