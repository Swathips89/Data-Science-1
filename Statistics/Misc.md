# Simpson's paradox
Simpson's paradox occurs when groups of data show one particular trend, but this trend is reversed when the groups are combined together. Understanding and identifying this paradox is important for correctly interpreting data.

Simpson’s paradox refers to a phenomena whereby the association between a pair of variables (X, Y ) reverses sign upon conditioning of a third variable, Z, regardless of the value taken by Z. If we partition the data into subpopulations, each representing a specific value of the third variable, the phenomena appears as a sign reversal between the associations measured in the disaggregated subpopulations relative to the aggregated data, which describes the population as a whole.
