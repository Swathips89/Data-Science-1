#### Types of Variables
Quantitative - Arithmetic operations makes sense <br/>
Categorical   <br/>

#### Quantitaive data
Robust statistics are unaffected by outliers(max or min) <br/>
A histogram is left skewed if it has the left tail larger than the right, and right skewed if the right tail is larger than its left <br/>
Empirical rule = The empirical rule (also know as three std.dev rule) states that for a normal distribution 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean value, 95% is within two standard deviation, and 99.7% is within three standard deviation <br/>

###### Operations
Minimum <br/>
Maximum <br/>
Mean <br/>
Median <br/>
1st Quantile - 25th percentile <br/>
3rd Quantile - 75th percentile <br/>
IQR - Diff between 1st & 3rd quantiles <br/>
lower fence/whisker = 1st quartile âˆ’ 1.5*IQR <br/>
upper fence/whisker = 3st quartile + 1.5*IQR <br/>
Range = Max - Min <br/>
Variance - Spread of the data <br/>
Standard Deviation - How far the data is deviated(dispersed) from the mean <br/>
