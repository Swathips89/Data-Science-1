#### Types of Variables
Quantitative - Arithmetic operations makes sense <br/>
Categorical   <br/>

#### Quantitaive data
* Robust statistics are unaffected by outliers(max or min) <br/>
* A histogram is left skewed if it has the left tail larger than the right, and right skewed if the right tail is larger than its left <br/>
* Empirical rule = The empirical rule (also know as three std.dev rule) states that for a normal distribution 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean value, 95% is within two standard deviation, and 99.7% is within three standard deviation <br/>
###### Normal Distributions
• Symmetry <br/>
• Unimodality (a single most common value) <br/>
• A continuous range from −∞ to +∞ (from negative infinity to positive infinity) <br/>
• A total area under the curve of 1 <br/>
• A common value for the mean, median, and mode <br/>
###### Operations
Spread of data - Range, IQR, std, variance, skewness, Kurtosis
* Minimum <br/>
* Maximum <br/>
* Mean <br/>
  * Mean of ORDINAL data doesn’t make sense because mean assumes equal intervals but in ordinal data we don’t know if the difference between 1 & 2 is same as the distance between 2 & 3
* Median  - Robust statistic <br/> 
* 1st Quantile - 25th percentile <br/>
* 3rd Quantile - 75th percentile <br/>
* IQR - Diff between 1st & 3rd quantiles <br/>
* lower fence/whisker = 1st quartile − 1.5*IQR <br/>
* upper fence/whisker = 3st quartile + 1.5*IQR <br/>
* Range = Max - Min <br/>
* Variance - Spread of the data from their average value - The average of the squared differences from the mean <br/>
* Standard Deviation - How far the data is deviated(dispersed) from the mean (Exact distances from mean) - square root of the variance is the standard deviation. It is not robust to outliers <br/>

Mean, Median, Mode are measures of central Tendancy <br/>
Range, IQR, Variance, Standard Deviation are measures of Variance <br/>

###### Graphical Representations
* Box plot
Difference between box plot and modified box plot - Box plot has min and Max, Modiified box plot has lower fence(1st Quartile-1.5IQR) and Upper fence (3rd Quartile+1.5IQR) (fences are whiskers), points outside whiskers are outliers
* Histogram
* Pareto chart - Bar chart and line chart combined. Bars are ordered in descending freq from left to right. Line chart displays cumulative freq.

#### Categorical data
###### Operations
* Frequency/Cumulative Frequency  <br/>
* Percentage  <br/>
###### Graphical Representations
* Bar chart (Pareto Chart - Bar graph ordered from highest to lowest freq)<br/>
* Line Plot - Freq over a number line
* Pie chart <br/>
