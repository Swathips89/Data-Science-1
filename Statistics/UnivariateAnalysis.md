#### Types of Variables
Quantitative - Arithmetic operations makes sense
Categorical - 

#### Operations on Quantitaive data
Robust statistics are unaffected by outliers(max or min)
A histogram is left skewed if it has the left tail larger than the right, and right skewed if the right tail is larger than its left
Empirical rule = The empirical rule (also know as three std.dev rule) states that for a normal distribution 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean value, 95% is within two standard deviation, and 99.7% is within three standard deviation

Minimum
Maximum
Mean
Median
1st Quantile - 25th percentile
3rd Quantile - 75th percentile
IQR - Diff between 1st & 3rd quantiles
lower fence/whisker = 1st quartile âˆ’ 1.5*IQR
upper fence/whisker = 3st quartile + 1.5*IQR
Range = Max - Min
Variance - Spread of the data
Standard Deviation - How far the data is deviated(dispersed) from the mean
