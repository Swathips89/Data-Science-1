#### Types of Variables
Quantitative - Arithmetic operations makes sense <br/>
Categorical   <br/>

#### Quantitaive data
* Robust statistics are unaffected by outliers(max or min) <br/>
* A histogram is left skewed if it has the left tail larger than the right, and right skewed if the right tail is larger than its left <br/>
* Empirical rule = The empirical rule (also know as three std.dev rule) states that for a normal distribution 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean value, 95% is within two standard deviation, and 99.7% is within three standard deviation <br/>
###### Normal Distributions
• Symmetry <br/>
• Unimodality (a single most common value) <br/>
• A continuous range from −∞ to +∞ (from negative infinity to positive infinity) <br/>
• A total area under the curve of 1 <br/>
• A common value for the mean, median, and mode <br/>
###### Operations
Measures of central Tendancy or location: Mean, truncated/trimmed mean, weighted mean, Median, weighted median, Mode <br/>
Spread of data or Measure of variability - Range, IQR, std dev, variance, skewness, Kurtosis, mean absolute dev, median absolute dev, percentiles
* Minimum <br/>
* Maximum <br/>
* Mean <br/>
  * Mean of ORDINAL data doesn’t make sense because mean assumes equal intervals but in ordinal data we don’t know if the difference between 1 & 2 is same as the distance between 2 & 3
* Weighted Mean: Weighted mean is a variant of mean that can be used in situations where the sample data does not represent different groups in a dataset. By assigning a larger weight to groups that are under-represented, the computed weighted mean will more accurately represent all groups in our dataset. Extreme values can easily influence both the mean and weighted mean since neither one is a robust metric! For eg: giving more weightage to battery life over design when choosing a phone. Robust statistic
* Trimmed Mean: The trimmed mean is used in calculating the final score in many sports where a panel of judges will each give a score. Then the lowest and the highest scores are dropped and the mean of the remaining scores are computed as a part of the final score. One such example is in the international diving score system. Robust statistic
* Median  - Robust statistic <br/> 
* Mode  Robust statistic <br/> 
* 1st Quantile - 25th percentile <br/>
* 3rd Quantile - 75th percentile <br/>
* IQR - Diff between 1st & 3rd quantiles <br/>
* lower fence/whisker = 1st quartile − 1.5*IQR <br/>
* upper fence/whisker = 3st quartile + 1.5*IQR <br/>
* Range = Max - Min <br/>
* Variance - Spread of the data from their average value - The average of the squared differences from the mean = Σ(Xi-Xavg)²/n <br/>
* Standard Deviation - How far the data is deviated(dispersed) from the mean (Exact distances from mean) - square root of the variance is the standard deviation. It is not robust to outliers <br/>
* Mean Absolute Deviation: Average of the sum of all absolute deviation from the mean
* Median Absolute Deviation (MAD): Like the arithmetic mean, none of the estimates of variability (variance, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation) is robust to outliers. Instead, we can use the median absolute deviation from the median to check how our data is spread out in the presence of outliers. The median absolute deviation is a robust estimator, just like the median. 
* NMiss - Number of missing values <br/>
* Percentiles: Robust statistic
* Skewness
* Kurtosis

###### Graphical Representations
* Box plot <br/>
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/11/understanding-boxplots.html <br/>
Difference between box plot and modified box plot - Box plot has min and Max, Modiified box plot has lower fence(1st Quartile-1.5IQR) and Upper fence (3rd Quartile+1.5IQR) (fences are whiskers), points outside whiskers are outliers
* Histogram


#### Categorical data
###### Operations
* Frequency/Cumulative Frequency  <br/>
* Percentage  <br/>
* Mode
* Unique Values
* NMiss - Number of Missing values <br/>
###### Graphical Representations
* Bar chart (Pareto Chart - Bar graph ordered from highest to lowest freq) <br/>
* Pareto chart - Bar chart and line chart combined. Bars are ordered in descending freq from left to right. Line chart displays cumulative freq.
* Line Plot - Freq over a number line
* Pie chart <br/>
* Frequency distribution
