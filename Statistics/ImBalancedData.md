## Disadvantages of Imbalanced data set:
A few classifier algorithms have bias towards classes that have more number of instances.They tend to only predict the majority class data.
The features of the minority class are treated as noise and are often ignored. Thus, there is a high probability of misclassification of the minority class as compared to the majority class.
