Chi sq goodness of fit - if a sample proportion is consistent with hypothesized distribution
chi sq test - if 2 categorical vars are idependent or not?
Fisher test is performed if Total N is <=90  (or) expected freq less than 5
Chi-sq test is performed only when atleast 80% of the cells have an expected frequency of 5 or greater
