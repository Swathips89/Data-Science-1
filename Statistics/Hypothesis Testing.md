Hypothesis testing is the use of statistics to determine the probability that a given hypothesis is true. The usual process of hypothesis testing consists of four steps.

1. Formulate the null hypothesis H_0 (commonly, that the observations are the result of pure chance) and the alternative hypothesis H_a (commonly, that the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation).

2. Identify a test statistic that can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis.

3. Compute the P-value, which is the probability that a test statistic at least as significant as the one observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis were true. The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.

4. Compare the p-value to an acceptable significance value  alpha (sometimes called an alpha value). If p<=alpha, that the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid.


Chi sq goodness of fit - if a sample proportion is consistent with hypothesized distribution
chi sq test - if 2 categorical vars are idependent or not?
Fisher test is performed if Total N is <=90  (or) expected freq less than 5
Chi-sq test is performed only when atleast 80% of the cells have an expected frequency of 5 or greater
Diff between chi-sq and Fischer exact test
