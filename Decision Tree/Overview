Difference between pruning and pre-pruning?

Splitting happens based on the variable that creates best homogeneous sets

# How Decision Tree predicts a Numeric Target?
In case of regression tree, the value obtained by terminal nodes in the training data is the mean response of observation falling in that
region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mean value

# How Decision Tree predicts a Categorical Target?
In case of classification tree, the value (class) obtained by terminal node in the training data is the mode of observations falling 
in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mode value.
