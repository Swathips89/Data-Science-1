# Bagging consists of sampling rows and variables randomly - so each individual tree is independent of the other. 
Result of many weaklearners is combined to create a strong learner

Both options are true. In Bagging, each individual trees are independent of each other because they consider different subset of features 
and samples.

In boosting tree individual weak learners are not independent of each other because each tree correct the results of previous tree. 
Bagging and boosting both can be consider as improving the base learners results.
