Cross-validation is performed to evaluate model but final model is built on entire data

* How should the input datasets for Train and Test be?
* How to run cross validation within Decision trees? Mention Sampling type for cross-validation?
* How to apply model to performance metrics of the decision tree from cv? AUC/Accuracy with 95% CI limits
* How to get the confusion matric of the train performance
* Decision tree - visulaization?
* Decision tree - rules

### Different functions
* Label encoder - To convert chars vars
* DecisionTreeClassifier
.fit
.predict_proba - Difference between predict & predict_proba
.roc_auc_score
.model_selection.cross_val_score
GridSearchCV
