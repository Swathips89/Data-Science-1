### Natural Language Understanding
* Phonology – This science helps to deal with patterns present in the sound and speeches related to the sound as a physical entity. 
* Pragmatics – This science studies the different uses of language.
* Morphology – This science deals with the structure of the words and the systematic relations between them.
* Syntax – This science deal with the structure of the sentences.
* Semantics – This science deals with the literal meaning of the words, phrases as well as sentences.

### Advances in NLP - https://ruder.io/a-review-of-the-recent-history-of-nlp/
* Neural Language Models - Language modelling is the task of predicting the next word in a text given the previous words. Egs - Intelligent keyboards, email response suggestion, spelling autocorrection, etc. Approaches are n-grams. Started with feed forward NN and currently uses RNNs, LSTM
* Multi-task Learning - Method for sharing parameters between models that are trained on multiple tasks. 
* Word embeddings
* Sequence to sequence models - Generate an output sequence by predicting one word at a time
* Attention
* Memory based networks
* Pretrained language models



### Word Embedding Approaches
* Word2Vec - Distributed representations
* GloVe
* ULMFit
* ELMo
* BERT
* RoBERTa - Robustly optimized Bert pretraining approach
* XLNet
* ALBERT - A Lite BERT
