### GPUs
* GPUs are specialized hardware originally created to render games in high frame rates. Graphics texturing and shading require a lot of matrix and vector operations executed in parallel and those chips have been created to take the heat off the CPU while doing that.
* Deep Learning really only cares about the number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) per second. GPUs are highly optimized for that.
