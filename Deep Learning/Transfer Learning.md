### Transfer Learning Scenarios
* The feature spaces of the source and target domain are different, e.g. the documents are written in two different languages.
* The marginal probability distributions of source and target domain are different, e.g. the documents discuss different topics. 
* The label spaces between the two tasks are different, e.g. documents need to be assigned different labels in the target task.
* The conditional probability distributions of the source and target tasks are different, e.g. source and target documents are unbalanced with regard to their classes.
