### Course Info
* Link - https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-medical-diagnosis/home/week/1
* PreRequisites - CNN, loss functions, Probability, Python
* Use Cases
  * Skin images to identify if a suspecious mole is cancerous or not
  * Opthalmology - Diabetic Rhetinopathy - Back of the eye retina images
  * Histopathology - Scanned microscopic images of tissue called whole slide images - to determine the extent to which a cancer has spread and then use to plan treatment, predict the course of the disease, and the chance of recovery
  * Chest X ray - To detect Pneumonia, lung cancer or Mass can be identified. 

### Medical Imaging
* Data of Chest X rays - https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315
* Challenges for training medical images - Class Imbalance; Multitask Challenge; Dataset size
* For multitask challange - Training of the multitask algorithm requires modification of loss function from binary tasks to multitask setting


 
 
 ### Modeling
 * Loss function measures the error between our output probability and the desired label
