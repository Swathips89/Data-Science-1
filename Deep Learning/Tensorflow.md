TensorFlow is an open source, high performance, library for numerical computation.  <br/>

Tensorflow APIs
* Core Tensorflow Python API - Numeric processing code, add, subtract, divide, matrix multiply etc. creating variables, creating tensors, getting the shape, all the dimensions of a tensor, all that core basic numeric processing stuff.  <br/>
* Components useful when building custon NN models <br/>
tf.layers - a way to create a new layer of hidden neurons, with a ReLU activation function. <br/>
tf.losses - a way to compute cross entropy with Logits.  <br/>
tf.metrics - a way to compute the root mean square error and data as it comes in. <br/>
* tf.estimator - knows how to do distributed training, it knows how to evaluate, how to create a checkpoint, how to Save a model, how to set it up for serving. It comes with everything done in a sensible way, that fits most machine learning models in production. <br/>
