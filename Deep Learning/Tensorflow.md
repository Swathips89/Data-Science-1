TensorFlow is an open source, high performance, library for numerical computation.  <br/>

Core Tensorflow Python API - Numeric processing code, add, subtract, divide, matrix multiply etc. creating variables, creating tensors, getting the shape, all the dimensions of a tensor, all that core basic numeric processing stuff.  <br/>

Components useful when building custon NN models
* tf.layers - a way to create a new layer of hidden neurons, with a ReLU activation function.
* tf.losses - a way to compute cross entropy with Logits. 
* tf.metrics - a way to compute the root mean square error and data as it comes in.
