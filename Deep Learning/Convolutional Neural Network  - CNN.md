Image classification

* Images have a lot of variation: 
  * Viewpoint variation
  * Illumination conditions
  * Scale variations
  * Deformation
  * Background clutter
  * Occlusion
  * Intr-class variation
* Models needs to be invariation to these above variations while still being sensitive to the differences that define the individual classes. Hence, features should be directly learnt from the data instead of hand engineering
* Visual features eg in a face
  * Low level features - Edges, dark spots
  * Eyes, ears, nose
  * Facial structure
