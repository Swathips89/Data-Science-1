Monte Carlo learning <br/>
Dynamic Learning <br/>


* Learning from interaction is the foundational underlying concept for all theories of learning and intelligence. Reinforcement learning occurs when algorithms learn based on external feedback given either by a thinking entity, or the environment. This approach is analogous to teaching dogs to sit or jump. <br/>
* Maximize future rewards over many time steps

* Key Terms:
  * Agent: Takes actions. eg- Drone, U
  * Environment: The world in which the agent exists and operates
  * Action: A move the agent can make in the environment; at is action at time t
  * Observation: Changes in environment after taking actions. Defines how agents interact with environment
  * State: Situation which agent percieves
  * Reward: Feedback that measures the success or failure of the agent's action
