Framework for Product Questions:
1. Clarifying the Question
What are the product goals? What’s the background context? We almost always start at an information disadvantage. So, what questions do we need to ask to bridge the gap?
2. Make Assumptions
Make some assumptions about the problem to narrow the scope. State what you’ll explore in your analysis and what you won’t.

3. Analyze User Flows

Examine exactly how the product works. How does a user get to a certain feature? How does a user use a certain feature? What kinds of different users are there?

4. Define Hypothesis

Start hypothesizing situations to explore that would help understand the root cause of the issue.

5. Draw Metrics to Support your Hypothesis

Use metrics as an example to further illustrate how it could prove or disprove your hypothesis. Remember to choose and prioritize which metrics you think are important. Choosing a bad metric that doesn’t represent the problem at hand can oftentimes be a red flag for an interviewer.

6. Tie Your Analysis to the Product Goals

Finally, tie your analysis back to the product goals. Give some sort of summary statement that can prioritize which ones matter and what the next steps are.

7. Remember to talk out loud

Talking out loud helps the interviewer see your thought process and lead you in the right direction if you get lost.

For example, if you don’t know the answer immediately, saying something like “Hm, I’m not exactly sure, but just thinking out loud…”, will help communicate the ambiguity of your initial answers while you figure out the right solution down the line.
